# macOS-Style Virtual Desktop Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Creating a web-based virtual desktop that precisely models the latest macOS (Sonoma/Sequoia) interface and behavior, focusing on the dock and menu bar as primary interaction points. No desktop icons - following the modern macOS app-centric workflow.

## Phase 1: Core macOS Infrastructure

### 1. Desktop Component Enhancement
- [ ] macOS-style wallpaper system with blur effects
- [ ] Clean desktop surface (no icons)
- [ ] Desktop context menu with macOS-style options
- [ ] Proper macOS color palette and background gradients

### 2. Menu Bar Component (macOS Style)
- [ ] Translucent menu bar at top with proper blur
- [ ] Apple menu equivalent on left
- [ ] App-specific menus (File, Edit, View, Window, Help)
- [ ] System status area on right (clock, wifi, battery indicators)
- [ ] Menu bar changes based on active application
- [ ] Proper typography and spacing matching macOS

### 3. Modern Window Component
- [ ] macOS window styling: rounded corners, drop shadows
- [ ] Traffic light buttons (red, yellow, green) with hover effects
- [ ] Translucent title bar with app name
- [ ] Smooth resize/drag animations
- [ ] Window focus/unfocus visual states
- [ ] Proper window chrome and proportions

## Phase 2: macOS Dock System

### 1. Dock Component
- [ ] Bottom-positioned dock with translucent background
- [ ] App launcher section with permanent apps
- [ ] Running apps with indicator dots
- [ ] Minimized windows section (right side after separator)
- [ ] Magnification effect on hover
- [ ] Smooth animations for app opening/closing
- [ ] Proper blur and transparency effects

### 2. Dock Interactions
- [ ] Right-click context menus on dock icons
- [ ] App launching from dock
- [ ] Window minimization to dock with genie effect
- [ ] Dock preferences (size, magnification, hiding)
- [ ] Drag and drop app organization

## Phase 3: macOS UX Patterns

### 1. Window Management
- [ ] Window minimize animation to dock
- [ ] Window maximize (full screen or fit)
- [ ] Window focus management with proper z-indexing
- [ ] Mission Control-style overview (optional)
- [ ] Window snapping and organization

### 2. Application Integration
- [ ] Sample apps with macOS-style interfaces
- [ ] App state persistence in dock
- [ ] Menu bar updates per active app
- [ ] Application lifecycle management

## Phase 4: Polish & macOS Details

### 1. Visual Polish
- [ ] Complete macOS color palette and typography (SF Pro, SF Mono)
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations matching macOS timing
- [ ] Blur effects and translucency throughout
- [ ] Dark/light mode support with automatic switching

### 2. Interaction Details
- [ ] macOS-style keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Proper focus and accessibility
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)
- [ ] Cursor changes and hover states

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
```
/wc/
├── desktop-component.js     # Main desktop container
├── menu-bar-component.js    # Top menu bar
├── dock-component.js        # Bottom dock
├── window-component.js      # Individual windows
└── dock-icon-component.js   # Dock application icons
```

### State Management
- **URL Parameters**: Open applications (`?apps=app1,app2`)
- **localStorage**: User preferences (dock position, wallpaper, app arrangements)
- **sessionStorage**: Window states (positions, sizes, z-index)

### macOS Design Tokens
- **Colors**: System colors, blur backgrounds, transparency levels
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display, SF Pro Text, system font sizes
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system, proper margins and padding
- **Animations**: Native macOS timing curves and durations

## Sample Applications to Implement
1. **Finder** - File browser with macOS interface
2. **TextEdit** - Simple text editor
3. **System Preferences** - Desktop customization settings
4. **Safari** - Simple web browser interface
5. **Activity Monitor** - System information display

## Success Criteria
- Pixel-perfect match to macOS interface elements
- Smooth 60fps animations and transitions
- Proper keyboard and mouse interaction patterns
- Responsive and accessible interface
- Clean, maintainable vanilla JavaScript code

The goal of this project is to create a web application for a virtual desktop environment where the windows are containers for standard web components. The desktop environment is inspired by mac os with as much of the standard desktop functionality as possible. This project will be built with vanilla html, css, and js with heavy use of standard web components, and will not use any 3rd party libraries or dependencies, no nodejs, npm or package.json for building.

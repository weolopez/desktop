# WE-OS Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Vanilla Web Technologies
Every component and feature MUST use only standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No third-party libraries, frameworks, or build tools are permitted. All code must run directly in modern web browsers without preprocessing or compilation.

This principle ensures maximum compatibility across browsers, simplifies the development process, and maintains the educational value of demonstrating pure web standards.

### II. Web Component Architecture
All UI elements and applications MUST be implemented as custom web components using the Shadow DOM for encapsulation. Components must be self-contained, reusable, and independently testable with clear public APIs defined via custom events and attributes.

This enforces modularity, prevents style and script leakage between components, and aligns with the project's goal of creating a component-based operating system simulation.

### III. Event-Driven Communication
Inter-component communication MUST exclusively use custom events dispatched through a centralized event bus. Direct DOM manipulation or global variables for coordination are prohibited. All messages must follow defined message types with validation.

This maintains loose coupling between components, enables scalable system growth, and mirrors real operating system inter-process communication patterns.

### IV. No Build Process
The entire project MUST operate without any build tools, bundlers, or Node.js dependencies. All files must load directly via HTML imports or ES6 modules in the browser. Development and deployment must be as simple as opening index.html.

This principle prioritizes accessibility for beginners, eliminates setup barriers, and demonstrates that complex applications can be built with pure web technologies.

### V. OS Simulation Fidelity
All features MUST implement genuine operating system behaviors within browser constraints, including process management, virtual file systems, windowing, and IPC. Superficial UI mimicry without functional depth is insufficient.

This ensures the project provides authentic educational value and a convincing OS experience, going beyond visual similarity to actual system simulation.

## Technical Constraints

- Browser Compatibility: Support latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. No support for legacy browsers.
- Performance: Achieve 60fps animations, load core system in under 2 seconds, and handle 50+ concurrent components without degradation.
- Accessibility: Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast.
- Security: No eval() or innerHTML for user input. All dynamic code loading must use Blob URLs with validation. Respect browser sandboxing.
- Storage: Use localStorage/sessionStorage for persistence, IndexedDB for larger data. No server-side assumptions.

## Development Workflow

- Code Review: All changes require peer review via pull requests. Reviews must verify constitution compliance.
- Testing: Manual browser testing required for each PR. Automated tests for component isolation and event handling.
- Documentation: Update README.md and relevant docs/*.md for all features. No undocumented public APIs.
- Branching: Feature branches named [###-description]. Main branch must always be deployable.
- Commits: Atomic commits with clear messages. No force pushes to shared branches.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project guidelines, templates, and practices. It defines the non-negotiable rules for WE-OS development.

**Amendment Procedure**:
1. Propose changes via a dedicated issue with rationale and impact analysis.
2. Review by at least two core contributors.
3. If approved, create a PR updating this file and all dependent templates/docs.
4. Include migration plan for breaking changes.
5. Merge requires consensus; major changes need explicit ratification.

**Versioning Policy**:
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to principles or architecture (e.g., allowing frameworks).
- MINOR: New principles or sections added.
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes without semantic changes.

**Compliance Review**:
- All PRs must include a constitution compliance checklist.
- Violations block merge unless justified with complexity tracking.
- Quarterly audits of codebase against principles.
- Use docs/WE-OS-Architecture.md for runtime development guidance.

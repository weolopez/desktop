# Feature Specification: Move from localStorage to IndexedDB for WEOS_DESKTOP

**Feature Branch**: `001-move-from-using`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "move from using localStorage to indexedDB WEOS_DESKTOP database"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What should happen if the browser does not support IndexedDB (e.g., very old versions or restricted environments)? ‚Üí A: Notify user of unsupported browser and disable storage-dependent features (e.g., no persistence)
- Q: For IndexedDB failures (e.g., quota exceeded, browser denial), what specific error behavior should be implemented? ‚Üí A: Notify user and pause new writes until user clears space or restarts
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent access or conflicts during data writes in IndexedDB? ‚Üí A: Use IndexedDB transactions for atomicity, no additional locking needed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of WE-OS, I want the desktop state (preferences, session data, and larger datasets) to be stored more efficiently and with greater capacity than localStorage allows, so that I can persist more complex configurations and files without hitting storage limits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has set desktop preferences (e.g., wallpaper, dock position), **When** they close and reopen the browser, **Then** those preferences are restored from the WEOS_DESKTOP database without data loss.
2. **Given** a user has multiple open windows and session state, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the session state is recovered from the database, maintaining window positions and focus.
3. **Given** the application attempts to store data exceeding localStorage limits, **When** using the new storage system, **Then** the data is successfully stored and retrieved without errors.

### Edge Cases
- If IndexedDB is not supported, notify user and disable storage-dependent features (no persistence).
- Concurrent access handled via IndexedDB transactions for atomicity, no additional locking.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use IndexedDB as the primary storage mechanism for user preferences, session state, and any data previously in localStorage.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support storing larger datasets (e.g., virtual file system contents, extensive configurations) that exceed localStorage quotas.
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle IndexedDB transactions asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI during reads/writes.
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement error handling for IndexedDB failures, such as quota exceeded or browser denial of access by notifying user and pausing new writes until user clears space or restarts.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **WEOS_DESKTOP Database**: Represents the primary storage for desktop state, including object stores for preferences (key-value pairs like wallpaper URL, dock position), session data (window states, z-index), and extended data (virtual files, configurations). Relationships: Preferences persist across sessions; session data is temporary but recoverable on refresh.

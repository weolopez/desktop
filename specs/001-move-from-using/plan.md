# Implementation Plan: IndexedDB Storage Migration for WE-OS

**Branch**: `001-move-from-using` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: specs/001-move-from-using/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-move-from-using/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The feature migrates WE-OS storage from localStorage to IndexedDB (WEOS_DESKTOP database) to support larger datasets for preferences, session state, and virtual file system contents. This enables persistence of complex configurations without localStorage quota limits, using asynchronous transactions and defined error handling.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Native Web APIs (IndexedDB, no external libraries)  
**Storage**: IndexedDB (primary), with in-memory fallback for unsupported cases  
**Testing**: Browser-based manual testing, console logs for transaction verification  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend-only, vanilla JS)  
**Performance Goals**: Asynchronous operations, no UI blocking (<50ms perceived latency for reads/writes)  
**Constraints**: No build process, vanilla JS only, graceful degradation for unsupported browsers  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop simulation, data up to 50MB+ (exceeding localStorage ~5MB limit)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Vanilla Web Technologies**: Compliant - Uses native IndexedDB API, no libraries.
- **Web Component Architecture**: N/A (storage service, not UI component), but integration with components via events.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Storage service will use events for success/failure notifications.
- **No Build Process**: Compliant - Direct browser API usage.
- **OS Simulation Fidelity**: Enhances persistence layer for better OS-like state management.
- **Technical Constraints**: Meets browser compatibility, performance (async), accessibility (N/A), security (sandboxed), storage (IndexedDB).
- **Development Workflow**: Will follow PR review, testing, documentation.

All principles satisfied; no violations.

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend-only). Updates focus on src/services for storage logic and tests for verification. No backend.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - No NEEDS CLARIFICATION in spec after clarification session.
   - Dependencies: IndexedDB API best practices for desktop apps.
   - Integration: Patterns for migrating from localStorage in web apps.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research IndexedDB best practices for web desktop storage"
   Task: "Find patterns for localStorage to IndexedDB migration in vanilla JS"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use IndexedDB with object stores for preferences, sessions, extended data.
   - Rationale: Higher capacity, structured storage, async support aligns with constitution.
   - Alternatives considered: sessionStorage (limited persistence), in-memory only (no persistence).

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity: WEOS_DESKTOP Database with object stores: preferences (key-value), sessions (window states), extended (files/configs).
   - Validation: Keys unique, values JSON-serializable.
   - State transitions: Write/read/delete async.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No external APIs; internal service methods: setItem(key, value, store), getItem(key, store), removeItem(key, store).
   - Output: Simple schema in contracts/storage-contracts.md (JSON-like for methods).

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test files in tests/contract/ for storage methods (e.g., test_setItem_success.json).
   - Assert request/response schemas (e.g., success: {status: 'ok'}, error: {status: 'error', message}).

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Story 1 → Test preference persistence across sessions.
   - Story 2 → Test session recovery on refresh.
   - Story 3 → Test large data storage success.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh roo`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - Add NEW tech: IndexedDB storage patterns, error handling.
   - Preserve manual additions between markers.
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3).
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency.
   - Output to repository root (docs/CLAUDE.md).

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Storage utils before service before integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

N/A - No violations.
